Hi, Iâ€™m Victor Rodriguez (@rodriguez-va), but many friends call me Bix.

I am a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Barbara working string theory, quantum field theory, and quantum gravity. 
Before that I was a postdoc at Princeton University. 
I obtained my PhD in theoretical physics at Harvard University in 2021.
